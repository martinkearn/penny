# Penny
A system for teaching internet safety to children and teenagers via an anonymous chat interface. 

Children are paired with another active user (either randomly or via pre-configured pairings) and are given the task of attempting to find what they can about the other user. Chats are logged and analysed for scenarios where children inadvertently reveal personal information to strangers.

Penny comprises a web-based chat interface and a web based Teacher Portal which is used for analysis.

## Origin
This system was originally designed and developed by a group of Microsoft software engineers at an internal hackathon. The original team were:
* Martin Kearn
* Nick Page
* Marian O'Sullivan
* Tracey Trewin
* Sherif El Mahdi
* Anastasia Zolochevska

### Penny?
The system is named after Inspector Gadget's niece 'Penny' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget). Penny is described as "know-it-all niece and the one who really stops the evil schemes. She uses many high tech devices to help her secretly solve the cases and stop the bad guys" this seemed to be a fitting description for this system for these reasons:
* Users investigate their anonymous chat partner via the system
* The system using technology (AI) to analyse and detect threats
* The system will go some way to stopping the "evil schemes" that children are vulnerable to online
